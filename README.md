# LEELAVATI LIBRARY

The Leelavati library is a Python implementation inspired by the classic mathematical treatise "Leelavati" written by 
the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya. This library aims to provide functions and utilities for various mathematical 
computations, drawing inspiration from the methods described in the original work.
